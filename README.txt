Fieldgroup Module
------------------------
by Wolfgang Ziegler, nuppla@zites.net


Description
-----------
This module allows you to create field groups for CCK fields. So you can
group your CCK node forms with the help of field groups.
Field groups can be set to be collapsible and can have descriptions.

The presentation of a node isn't touched. The fields are still ordered
by their weights without caring about their field groups.

NOTE: You have to patch CCK, or this module won't work correctly.
Read the installation instruction.

Installation 
------------
 * Verify that your CCK modules are up to date.
 * Copy the fieldgroup's directory to your modules directory and activate the module.


Dependency: 
CCK (Content Construction Kit) version from 15.08.06 or later
